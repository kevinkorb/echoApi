Client API To Interact with Echo 19's Products

This project contains a working PHP client allowing the user to Add Clients, Get Clients, Add Lists, and Create Calls.  Additional functionality will be exposed as it is completed.

Simply start by symlinking or copying the config-prod.php to config.php.

Change the login credentials in config.php to match your credentials.

This was designed to be as simple as possible.

examples.php contains sample usage for the different API requests.
